   <p> Your child won't keep his or her first teeth forever, but that doesn't mean those tiny pearly whites don't need conscientious care.
    Maintaining your child's dental health now will provide health benefits well into adulthood, as primary (baby) teeth serve some extremely important functions.</p>
    
    <p>For one thing, primary teeth serve as guides for the eruption of permanent (adult) teeth, holding the space into which these new teeth will erupt. 
    The crowns (tops) of the permanent teeth actually push against the roots of the baby teeth, causing them to resorb, or melt away. 
    In this way, the adult teeth can take their proper place.</p>
    
    <p>What's more, your child's primary teeth will be there for most of childhood, helping your child to bite, chew and speak. 
    For the first six or so years, he or she will be relying on primary teeth exclusively to perform these important functions.
    Until around age 12, your child will have a mix of primary and permanent teeth.
    You will want to make sure those teeth stay healthy and are lost naturally — when it's time.</p>
    
   <h3><b> Your Child's First Teeth</h3></b>
   <p> Your child's 20 baby teeth will begin to appear usually between six and nine months, though in some cases it may start as early as three months or as late as twelve months.
    The two lower front teeth tend to erupt first, followed by the two upper ones. 
    The first molars come in next, followed by the canines (eyeteeth).
    Sometimes your baby can experience teething discomfort during this process. 
    If so, let us know and we will advise you as to the best course of action.</p>

<p>Your infant's gums and newly erupting teeth should be gently wiped after each feeding with a water-soaked gauze pad or damp washcloth. 
Starting at age 2, when there are more teeth in the mouth, establish a daily brushing routine with a small, soft-bristled toothbrush and no more than a thin smear of fluoridated toothpaste.
Your child may need your help with this important task until about the age of 6.</p>

<h3><b>Pediatric Dental Treatments</h3></b>

<p>There are a variety of dental treatments we provide to prevent tooth decay in children, or to save or repair teeth when necessary.
They include:<br>

<h3><b>Topical Fluoride</h3></b> — Fluoride incorporates into the enamel of teeth, making it harder and more resistant to decay. 
Although there is a small amount of fluoride in toothpastes and in some drinking water supplies, we can apply a higher concentration onto your child's teeth for maximum protection.<br>

<h3><b>Dental Sealants</h3></b> — We can apply a plastic coating that prevents cavities by sealing the little grooves on the chewing surfaces of back teeth known as “pits and fissures.” 
These little crevices become the perfect environments for decay-causing bacteria.
Immature tooth enamel is more permeable and therefore less resistant to tooth decay. 
Dental sealants are easy to apply and provide years of protection.<br>

<h3><b>Root Canal Treatment</h3></b> — Perhaps you have had a root canal treatment yourself, to save an injured or severely decayed tooth.
Well, sometimes children need root canals, too.
As mentioned above, baby teeth are important guides to the permanent teeth that are already forming beneath your child's gums. 
Therefore, saving them from premature loss can help prevent a malocclusion (“mal” – bad; “occlusion” – bite) that requires orthodontic treatment.<br>

<h3><b>Bonding </h3></b>— Chips and minor fractures to front teeth — common childhood occurrences — can be repaired with tooth-colored bonding materials.
These lifelike resins made of plastic and glass can be used on baby teeth as well as permanent teeth and last until the youngster has completed facial growth
