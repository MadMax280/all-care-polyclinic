   <p>Periodontal diseases range from simple gum inflammation to serious disease that results in major damage to the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth. 
   In the worst cases, teeth are lost.</p>

<p>Gum disease is a threat to your oral health.
Research is also pointing to possible health effects of periodontal diseases that go well beyond your mouth (more about this later).
Whether it is stopped, slowed or gets worse depends a great deal on how well you care for your teeth and gums every day, from this point forward.</p>

<h3><b>What causes Periodontal Disease?</h3></b>
<p> Our mouths are full of bacteria.
These bacteria, along with mucus and other particles, constantly form a sticky, colorless "plaque" on teeth. 
Brushing and flossing help get rid of plaque.
Plaque that is not removed can harden and form bacteria-harboring "tartar" that brushing doesn't clean.
Only a professional cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist can remove tartar.</p>

<h3><b>Gingivitis</h3></b>
<p>The longer plaque and tartar are on teeth, the more harmful they become.
The bacteria cause inflammation of the gums that is called "gingivitis." 
In gingivitis, the gums become red, swollen and can bleed easily.</p>

<h3><b>Signs & Symptoms</h3></b>

<p>Gum disease can be painless, so it is important to be aware of any of the following symptoms:<br>

    Swollen, red, tender or bleeding gums<br>

    Gums that recede or move away from the tooth<br>

    Persistent bad breath or bad taste in mouth<br>

    Loose teeth<br>

    Visible pus surrounding the teeth and gums</p><br>

   <p> When left untreated, however, gingivitis can progress into a more serious condition called periodontitis. 
       Toxins from this buildup of bacterial plaque not only affect your gum tissue, but also the bone and ligaments that support your teeth. 
       As the infection causes disease to the bone and supporting tissues, your teeth may eventually become loose and need to be treated surgically or removed.
       But even advanced cases of periodontal disease don't have to progress to this point.</p>

<h3><b>Nonsurgical Treatment</h3></b>

 <p>Your first step in treating periodontitis is a conservative, nonsurgical treatment called scaling and root planing (SRP). 
A dentist or dental hygienist provides this treatment by scraping and removing the plaque and tartar off of your teeth and root surfaces by scaling, and then smoothing away any roughness on the roots to prevent bacteria from gathering again.</p> 

<h3><b>Pocket Reduction Procedure</h3></b>

 <p>After scaling and root planing, if the gum tissue is not fitting snugly around the tooth and you can't keep the deep pocket area clean, you may be a candidate for periodontal pocket reduction or flap surgery.
By folding back the gum tissue, your dentist or periodontist can remove infectious bacteria and smooth areas of damaged bone, allowing the gum tissue to re-attach to healthy bone.</p>

<h3><b>Gum Grafts</h3></b>

<p>Exposed roots due to gum recession can be covered with gum grafts, wherein gum tissue is taken from your palate or from another source and used to cover the roots of one or more teeth.
Covering exposed roots helps reduce sensitivity and protects your roots from decay, while stopping further gum recession and bone loss.</p>

<h3><b>Regenerative Procedures</h3></b>

<p>Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that promotes the growth of bone in an area where bone has been destroyed by periodontal disease. 
During this type of treatment, your dentist or periodontist will eliminate bacteria and then place either natural or synthetic bone in the area of bone loss, along with tissue-stimulating proteins to help your body effectively regrow bone and tissue.</p>
        
<h3><b>Periodontal Maintenance</h3></b>

<p>Anyone who has had treatment for advanced periodontal disease knows that meticulous homecare is the key to keeping periodontal disease from rearing its ugly head – again.
Because personal oral care is a big part of any periodontal treatment plan, your dentist or dental hygienist will spend lots of time with you making sure you understand and implement proper brushing and flossing techniques at home.
He or she may also recommend products like Colgate® PerioGard®, a prescription-strength antimicrobial mouthwash to help reduce bacteria in hard-to-reach areas of your mouth.</p>

<p>In addition to not smoking, which inhibits the healing process, your dentist will also recommend keeping a close eye on your periodontal health with more frequent checkups and cleaning appointments.
When dealing with periodontal disease, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."</p>
